# Welcome to the Cosmic Academy, future Cosmonaut!

Many dreamed to become a Cosmonaut, when they grow up... <br />
And even if most of these dreams didn't come true, the desire probably didn't disappear. <br />
We decided to help you realize your childhood dream and make you a Cosmonaut! <br />

Of course, our Cosmic Academy will not make you a Cosmonaut, but it will make you a Digital Cosmonaut! <br />

Together with you, we will go through a full training course, during which you will acquire all the necessary knowledge and skills that will help you navigate the ever-expanding [Cosmos Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem) and beyond! <br />

The training course consists of 10 lessons, each of which will be recorded, then edited and published as educational material: <br />
- What is the Cosmos Ecosystem and how to use it
- An overview of the necessary tools to use the Cosmos Ecosystem
- Digital security and what not to do in the Cosmos Ecosystem
- Delegators, Validators, how to stake and to whom 
- Cosmos DEXs and how to trade on them
- From crypt to fiat and back
- Airdrops and distributions in the Cosmos Ecosystem - how not to miss and get
- How to understand which project is important and which not
- Community Role and Network Management in the Cosmos Ecosystem
- How to find yourself in the Cosmos Ecosystem
